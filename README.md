# Air-Quality-Index-Prediction
Project Overview
The Air Quality Index Prediction project aims to develop a model that accurately predicts the air quality index (AQI) based on historical air quality data and various environmental factors. This project leverages machine learning techniques to provide valuable insights into air pollution levels and help mitigate its impact on public health.

Key Features
Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gathering real-time and historical air quality data from reliable sources, cleaning, and preparing the data for analysis.

Model Development: Implementing and optimizing machine learning algorithms to predict AQI with high accuracy.

Visualizations: Providing intuitive visualizations and dashboards to showcase AQI trends and predictions.

Alerts and Notifications: Generating timely alerts and notifications to inform users about poor air quality conditions.

Benefits
Public Health: Early prediction of AQI can help individuals take preventive measures to reduce exposure to harmful air pollutants.

Policy Making: Policymakers can use AQI predictions to design and implement effective air quality management strategies.

Awareness: Increasing public awareness about air quality issues and encouraging community actions to reduce air pollution.

Research and Development: Providing a robust dataset and model for further research and development in the field of air quality monitoring.
